I graduated with a Master's degree in Data Science and Scientific Computing from the University of Trieste (Italy). In the last years, I have been refining my skills as a Data Scientist, specializing in the use of libraries such as PyTorch, Scikit-learn and Matplotlib. 
In parallel, I am deepening my frontend development with Angular and Next.js, gaining a solid understanding of MVC design patterns, ORM databases, and CI/CD techniques. Some significant projects in this area are the nemoai.eu and fantacreator.com websites.
Currently, I work as a Data Scientist Trainee at the European Central Bank, where I developed a GPT-2 model with PyTorch to monitor in real time the compliance of Single Data Dictionary (SDD) codes with the naming conventions and principles established by the ECB. In addition, I created a Python library to automatically manage the generation and maintenance of logical transformation rules for FinREP.
During an internship at Generali Investments, I contributed to the development of portfolio optimization software in Python and Streamlit, and participated in the creation of a system using RAG, integrated with Langchain and ChatGPT's Azure API, for internal document due diligence.
In my initial experience at Luxottica, I managed two industrial projects using AGVs (autonomous guided vehicles) to improve internal processes. This experience allowed me to develop project management skills, such as planning using Gantt, and to effectively manage communication with management and suppliers.
I am convinced that my ability to work in different contexts and languages, combined with my experience with the technologies needed to develop end-to-end solutions, can be of great value to your company. I hope to make these skills available and have the opportunity to discuss them further soon.
